Week 3 Reflection: Frequency of Letters in English words and where they occur in the word: https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/lot486/frequency_of_letters_in_english_words_and_where/

This visualization displays the frequency of each letter's usage in the English language, as well as their frequency in each position of a word. It makes use of colors and bar charts to display this. The visualization uses redundancy in a useful way. Both color and height represent the percentage of use for each position with each letter, which helps emphasize the point. Additionally it allows the bars within each graph to be measured relatively to each other but not others. This allows letters with drastically different frequencies to all have graphs with similarly sized bars, where the differences between them are visible though color, not height. I appreciate the order of the letters from most frequent to least frequent. Though each letter is colored according to and labelled with its overall frequency, I'd be interested in seeing one graph visualizing each letter's overall frequency compared to each other. It's harder to visualize diffences based on color alone for the overall frequency. One minor issue I noticed was that 'I' looks like it is another bar in the bar chart. I also wonder if the color scale runs the risk of misrepresenting the differences in frequency, as the lightest color in the scale covers the range of 0 to 0.1 while the darkest covers 20 to 50. It would be interesting to see if scaling it differently impacted the viewers perception of this data.
