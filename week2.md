Week 2 Reflection: An orbit map of the solar system https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/infographics/an-orbit-map-of-the-solar-system

The aim of this visualization is to display the orbits of objects in our solar system. Each object is represented by a dot or line with a trailing path behind it displaying its orbit path. Colors represent the type, while dot size represents size, with lines being used for unknown diameters. I think this infographic does really well displaying how densely filled parts of our solar system are. With the color coding, it helps give a sense of scale of how many asteroids there are of each type. There are labels for many asteroids/objects, making it fun to explore the visualization. However, attempts to search for a particular asteroid would be very difficult, as the visualization is densely packed, and as a still image, there is no way to filter it. One thing I noticed was that the distance scale grows exponentially. This might mislead viewers into having an incorrect sense of distance between objects. However a visualization with linear scale would likely be prohibitively large for a single image. In order to provide a sense of distance, an interactive visualization that allows one to zoom in and out may work better. The visualization as it stands is very visually pleasing and fun to explore. I'd love to see an animated/interactive version of it where objects are animated orbiting and you could search/filter them.
