Week One Reflection: League of Legends Class combinations https://datacrayon.com/posts/statistics/data-is-beautiful/league-of-legends-classes/

The aim of this chord diagram is to visualize the distribution of class combinations for champions in the video game League of Legends. While browsing through r/dataisbeautiful, this chord diagram stood out as really pretty, though not immediately understandable. At first glance, the information looks like a tangled mess of colors, but hovering over individual stripes will lower the opacity on all others, making it easier to read. I really enjoyed the feature of displaying the champions applicable to the given class combination when you are hovering over the stripes. One of my bigger complaints with this visualization is that it is difficult to see information about single class champions, especially with classes like the tank class, where there is only one single class champion. Two versions of this visualization are provided: one where each category fades from its own color to that of the connecting class, and the other where it starts from the connecting class's color and fades back to its own. The first chart is prettier, but is more difficult to retrieve information from at a glance. The second appears aesthetically messy, but gives a better sense of the distributions of each class combination. For example, for the fighter class, you can quickly tell that the majority cross over with tanks, and then assassins. This type of visualization seems like an interesting way to display connections, though I worry it would be lacking from an accessibility perspective. The colors may be an issue for colorblind users.
